HOW to read it:

bool public locked = true;  //rightmost bits of index[0]
uint256 public constant ID = block.timestamp; //Not indexed
uint8 private flattening = 10; //rightmost bits of index[0] - 2 hexas:8 bits
uint8 private denomination = 255; //rightmost bits of index[0] - 4 hexas:16 bits
uint16 private awkwardness = uint16(now); //bits of index[0] -6 hexas
bytes32[3] private data; //indexes 1,2,3 occupied by each piece
*/

/*
KEY: in position idx=3

used in smart contract:

bytes16(key)

You just take the first half of the bytes32 data and thatâ€™s going to be your
new bytes16 type data.
Calling the unlock method with that as an input parameter should clear up the last hurdle.

MESSAGE

Nothing in the ethereum blockchain is private.
The keyword private is merely an artificial construct of the Solidity language.
Web3's getStorageAt(...) can be used to read anything from storage.
It can be tricky to read what you want though, since several optimization rules and techniques
are used to compact the storage as much as possible.
It can't get much more complicated than what was exposed in this level.
